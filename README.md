# Creation of a DHT

## Description
This project implements a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) using SimPy to simulate a network of nodes. Each node can store and retrieve data with a replication mechanism on immediate neighbors.

## Features
- Dynamic addition of nodes in a distributed ring
- Data storage and retrieval with replication on 3 nodes
- Node removal and management
- Display of the ring state

## Installation
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install SimPy if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install simpy
   ```
3. Run the main script to start the simulation.
